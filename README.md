## Hi, I'm Mitchell : - )
I like typing fast and also Python. I used to be a French teacher. Now, I'm a dev in the US Air Force

### Current work
I'm working with clients as a contract computer programmer and data analyst. I write simple automation programs for local folks and I do light BI (Business Intelligence) and data analysis for small businesses. If you'd like a glance of my work experience, I have an online CV [here](https://mitchell-lagaras.dev).

### Other Projects
What you see here is mostly some fun projects I do when I find the time. If you want to tinker with anything I've built, please feel free to reach out.

### Connecting
I'm always happy to expand my network. If you want to build something together, reach out! My contact info is available on my website.
